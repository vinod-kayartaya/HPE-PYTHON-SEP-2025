# Understanding Generators and Iterators in Python

Efficient data processing often requires handling large datasets without consuming too much memory. Python provides **iterators** and **generators** to process sequences one element at a time, saving memory and improving performance.

In this article, weâ€™ll cover:

- What iterators are
- Creating and using iterators
- What generators are
- Creating and using generators
- Practical examples

## Iterators in Python

An **iterator** is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning you can traverse through all its elements one by one.

### Creating an Iterator

```python
# A simple list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Get an iterator
it = iter(numbers)

print(next(it))  # 1
print(next(it))  # 2
print(next(it))  # 3
print(next(it))  # 4
# next(it)  # StopIteration if uncommented
```

- Use `iter()` to create an iterator from an iterable (list, tuple, string, etc.)
- Use `next()` to get the next item
- Raises `StopIteration` when no items are left

### Custom Iterator Class

You can create your own iterator by implementing `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods:

```python
class Squares:
    def __init__(self, max):
        self.max = max
        self.n = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.n < self.max:
            result = self.n ** 2
            self.n += 1
            return result
        else:
            raise StopIteration

for sq in Squares(5):
    print(sq)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
4
9
16
```

## Generators in Python

Generators are a simpler way to create iterators using **functions and the `yield` keyword**. They are memory-efficient because they generate items one at a time.

### Simple Generator Function

```python
def square_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

for num in square_numbers(5):
    print(num)
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
4
9
16
```

- `yield` produces a value and pauses the function
- Next iteration resumes from the last `yield`

### Generator Expressions

Similar to list comprehensions, but lazy (memory-efficient):

```python
squares = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))

print(next(squares))  # 0
print(next(squares))  # 1
for num in squares:
    print(num)         # 4, 9, 16
```

### Practical Example: Reading Large Files

Suppose you have a large log file. Using a generator avoids loading the whole file into memory:

```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.strip()

for line in read_large_file("big_log.txt"):
    if "ERROR" in line:
        print(line)
```

This reads and processes the file **line by line**, saving memory.

### Chaining Generators

Generators can be combined for pipelines:

```python
def numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

def even_numbers(nums):
    for n in nums:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            yield n

for e in even_numbers(numbers(10)):
    print(e)
```

**Output:**

```
0
2
4
6
8
```

## Key Differences Between Iterators and Generators

| Feature  | Iterator                                    | Generator                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Creation | Custom class with `__iter__` and `__next__` | Function with `yield` or generator expression |
| Memory   | Can store entire sequence                   | Produces items on the fly                     |
| Syntax   | More verbose                                | Simpler and concise                           |
| Reusable | Can be reset if class allows                | Not resettable; exhausted after iteration     |

## Conclusion

Generators and iterators are essential tools for working with sequences efficiently in Python:

- **Iterators** provide a protocol to traverse any iterable object.
- **Generators** simplify the creation of iterators and are memory-efficient.
- They are especially useful for **large datasets, streaming data, and pipelines**.

By mastering iterators and generators, you can write **more efficient and Pythonic code**.
